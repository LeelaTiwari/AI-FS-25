                GitHub is a powerful platform that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code using a system called Git. It helps track changes in files, making it easier for individuals or teams to work together without overwriting each other’s work. GitHub is widely used in both professional and educational settings for software development. It supports open-source contributions, enabling developers to share their projects with the world and allow others to learn from or improve them. Key features like pull requests, branches, issue tracking, GitHub Actions for automation, and GitHub Pages for hosting websites make it a complete development environment. It also integrates well with tools like Slack and Trello, making project management seamless. For beginners, GitHub is a valuable learning tool to understand version control, explore real-world projects, and build a portfolio by contributing to public repositories.</p>
